***EasyVolcap*** is a PyTorch library for accelerating neural volumetric video research, particularly in areas of volumetric video capturing, reconstruction, and rendering.

Built on popular and easy-to-use frameworks like `Python`, `PyTorch`, `ImGUI`, `OpenGL` and `CUDA` and tailored for researchers, the framework is easily extensible for idea exploration, fast prototyping, and conducting various ablative and comparison experiments.

Coming from the [`ZJU3DV`](https://github.com/zju3dv) research group at State Key Lab of CAD&CG, Zhejiang University, this framework is the underlying warehouse for many of our projects, papers and new ideas.
We sincerely hope this framework will be useful for researchers with similar backgrounds and research interests in volumetric videos.

***Source code is coming after weekend!***
